Selenium is a powerful framework for testing web apps and the UI

Requirements:
-------------

* Knowledge on navigation in command line
* Familiarity with HTML & Web Elements


### Applications to Download:

* **Ruby: **Ruby is used to write the test code & no prior knowledge of ruby required 
* **Internet Browser:** Firefox 
* **Text Editor:** Sublime text (but I choose atom)


Ruby is used to write the test code & no prior knowledge of ruby required

Selenium overview:
------------------

* Created by Jason Huggins while he worked at ThoughtWorks. Huggins was working on an internal time expense application and needed to make sure that the app was always working
* **Goal:** save time manually testing


### Selenium version 1
The API backing the first version of Selenium was called Selenium RC (Remote Control)
Selenium RC used a proxy server that injected JavaScript into a browser in order to control it and drive the interactions
In 2006 Simon stuart created WebDriver which solved some of Selenium RC's pain points by not relying on intrusive JavaScript injection
to drive the interactions through a browser

### Selenium 2.0
Instead a client is provided for each browser, each client had its own API and allowed native calls to be made directly to the browser
Then in 2009 Selenium & Webdriver were merged â‡’ Selenium 2.0. This version supported the RC and Webdriver APIs but users were encouraged to use the webdrivers only

### Selenium 3.0
In 2016, Selenium 3.0 was introduced which lost support for RC so it is only backed by webdriver API. Also now browser vendors are responsible to manage their own drivers. A new W3C specification is introduced for browser automation based on the open source web driver thus there are standards and guidelines for the API

#### Major Supprt

* All programming languages
* Platforms and browsers
* A variety of testing tools 
* Compatibility with other fraeworks and applications
* Opensource with strong community



### Tools Needed for writing tests

1. Selenium Webdriver
2. geckodriver (make sure the executable in the system PATH)
3. rspec (ruby gem to add assertions)


##### Note:

* Gems are independent software packages (library/plug in)
* RubyGems is the package management framework
* Each Gem needs to be installed before using it, can be installed via gem install (present with ruby install) or bundler (needs gemfile, good for share Project)
